# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- ASP.NET MVC UI project.
- Source: `Controllers/`, `Views/`, `Helpers/`, `Extensions/`, `App_Start/`, `Global.asax`.
- Assets: `Content/` (CSS, SCSS, images, plugins), `Scripts/`.
- Config: `Web.config` with transforms `Web.Debug.config`, `Web.Release.config`.
- Bundling/compilation: `App_Start/BundleConfig.cs`, `compilerconfig.json*` for SCSS/minification.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Visual Studio: open the solution or `GESTION_COLEGIAL.UI.csproj`, set as Startup, run (IIS Express).
- Restore packages (packages.config): `nuget restore` or via Visual Studio on open.
- CLI build (Debug/Release):
  - `msbuild .\GESTION_COLEGIAL.UI.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug`
  - `msbuild .\GESTION_COLEGIAL.UI.csproj /p:Configuration=Release`
- Static assets: keep SCSS in `Content/sass`; compiled/minified outputs should match `compilerconfig.json` and bundles in `BundleConfig`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- C#: 4-space indentation, Allman braces, using directives at top.
- Naming: PascalCase for classes/methods; camelCase for locals/parameters.
- MVC: controllers end with `Controller` (e.g., `AlumnosController`); views live in `Views/<Controller>/<Action>.cshtml`.
- Partials/Layouts: prefix with `_` (e.g., `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`).
- Keep async naming consistent (e.g., `CreateAsync.cshtml` and corresponding actions).

## Testing Guidelines
- No test project is included here. If adding tests:
  - Create a sibling project `GESTION_COLEGIAL.UI.Tests` (xUnit or MSTest).
  - Name files `<TypeName>Tests.cs`; test action routes and filters.
  - For UI flows, prefer Playwright/Selenium with stable selectors.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: small, focused, imperative subject (e.g., "Add Semestres index view").
- Reference issues in the footer (e.g., `Refs #123`).
- PRs must include:
  - Summary of changes and rationale.
  - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
  - Steps to validate locally and any config notes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets in `Web.config`. Use config transforms and environment-specific overrides.
- Keep connection strings and API keys out of source control.
- Do not commit built/minified files if generated by the build; commit sources (SCSS, TS) instead.

## Agent-Specific Instructions
- Follow existing patterns in `App_Start` and bundling.
- Avoid broad refactors; prefer minimal, well-scoped changes.
- Place new assets under `Content/` and wire them through `BundleConfig`.
